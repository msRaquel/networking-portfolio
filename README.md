# Networking Labs Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on networking experience with both
Cisco Packet Tracer simulations and real Cisco hardware in my university lab. 

As well as self-led projects I have worked on outside of university.

## Physical Labs
- **Switching Lab** – Demonstarted Ethernet switch forwarding process by configuring hosts to Catalyst 3750 Series Ethernet switches. Exemplifying my understanding of the data-link layer.
- **Router Configuration** – Configured Routers and Hosts to succesfuly interconnect local networks. Confirming how routers forward packets and my inderstanding of protocols at the network layer. 
- **Network Programming** – Connected multiple networks and verified routing tables. Wrote software that succesfully acted as a Server or Client sending TCP packets to hosts using the Socket API infrastructure.

## Self-led Projects
- **Pi-hole using Raspberry Pi Model 4B** - Pi-hole blocks Ads on your home network by acting as a DNS sinkhole. Through this project I strenghtened my understanding of DNS servers, queries, and how to speed up my home network by not having to load ads.
