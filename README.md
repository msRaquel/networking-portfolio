# Networking Labs Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on networking experience with both
Cisco Packet Tracer simulations and real Cisco hardware in my university lab.

## Physical Labs
- **Switching Lab** – Demonstarted Ethernet switch forwarding process by configuring hosts to Catalyst 3750 Series Ethernet switches. Exemplifying my understanding of the data-link layer.
- **Router Configuration** – Configured Routers and Hosts to succesfuly interconnect local networks. Confirming how routers forward packets and my inderstanding of protocols at the network layer. 
- **Network Programming** – Connected multiple networks and verified routing tables.

## Simulated Labs (Packet Tracer)
