# Networking Labs Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on networking experience with both
Cisco Packet Tracer simulations and real Cisco hardware in my university lab.

## Physical Labs
- **VLAN Switching Lab** – Configured VLANs and trunk links between three Cisco 2960 switches.
- **Router OSPF Configuration** – Implemented dynamic routing on Cisco 1941 routers.
- **Static Routing & Troubleshooting** – Connected multiple networks and verified routing tables.

## Simulated Labs (Packet Tracer)
- **Two-LAN Network**
- **DHCP and DNS Configuration**
- **Access Control Lists (ACL)**
